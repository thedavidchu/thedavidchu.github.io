Welcome to my [personal website](https://thedavidchu.github.io/)!

## About

I started this project on Saturday, June 27, 2020 after being inspired by Matt Ing's website (@matthew-ing) and working on HTML and Javascript in my work at Kepler Communications Inc. as a Regulatory Engineering Intern.

## More info to come!

## Chess

There is a chess engine that I wrote in JavaScript. There is a lot of CSS that I need to clean up.

## TODO
* Clean up file structure and rename everything
* Unit tests?
* Make a separate folder called "pages" to store HTML stuff
* Generate my website with templates!
